<h3>cHAPTER 1 aRCHITECTUREnEUTRAL</h3>
<p>The java code is converted into byte code which is architectural neutral  object file format , This code can be executed on any machine given the presence of java run time system 

They are very easy to interpret on any machine and are easily converted into native machine code on the fly</p>  

<p>Generating code for a virtual machine is not a new idea at that time Languages like LISP , PASAL are using it before also.</p> 

<p>Interpreting virtual code is slower than directly interpreting the machine code , However most frequently code was compiled into native machine code by JIT (Just in Time) compiler </p> 

<p>The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a component of the Java&#8482; Runtime Environment that improves the performance of Java applications at run time.</p> 

<p>Java programs consists of classes, which contain platform-neutral bytecodes that can be interpreted by a JVM on many different computer architectures. At run time, the JVM loads the class files, determines the semantics of each individual bytecode, and performs the appropriate computation. The additional processor and memory usage during interpretation means that a Java application performs more slowly than a native application. The JIT compiler helps improve the performance of Java programs by compiling bytecodes into native machine code at run time.</p> 

 

<p>In practice, methods are not compiled the first time they are called. For each method, the JVM maintains a call count, which is incremented every time the method is called. The JVM interprets a method until its call count exceeds a JIT compilation threshold. Therefore, often-used methods are compiled soon after the JVM has started, and less-used methods are compiled much later, or not at all. The JIT compilation threshold helps the JVM start quickly and still have improved performance. The threshold has been carefully selected to obtain an optimal balance between startup times and long term performance.</p> 

 

<p>The JVM also increases the security also as it can check the behaviour of  instruction sequence.</p>
